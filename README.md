#This is a website i'm designing in my spare time to practice html and css fundamentals.

#As time goes on, it should start to mirror what my journey has been like learning web development.

#Also, I hope to add some cool functionality that makes it an interactive experience.

#When it's finally done, I plan to use this as my landing page to launch myself into a different career
altogether.
